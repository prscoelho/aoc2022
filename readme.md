# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2022

This year I can't wake up at 5 AM so I'm not trying to go fastest time to solution, this is an attempt at clean, maintainable code.

## Running

The project expects a folder named input next to src (not inside) with filenames as below:

```
src/
input/
  01.input
  02.input
```

Run with:

`cargo run --release -- {day from 1-25}`

Example:

`cargo run --release -- 1`
